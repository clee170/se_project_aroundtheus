This is a feed of different location that this person has gone too. You are able to like the photos (gotta figure out how that works). You can load it up on desktop or mobile. You can like the pictures as well as add pictures to your profile. You are able to edit your profile as well.

In this project we put to use our skill of designing a responsive layout that doesnt degrade quality when swapping to a mobile set up. Using the new skill of 'grid' display and flexbox we were able to organize everything in an efficent way. Using the meadia function was the hardest for me to understand but using it allows you to change some of the values for smaller screen sizes. It really is helpful and a great tool when crating a responsive layout.
